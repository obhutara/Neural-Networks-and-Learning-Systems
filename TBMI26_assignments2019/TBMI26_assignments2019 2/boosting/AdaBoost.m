%% Implement the AdaBoost training here
%  Use your implementation of WeakClassifier and WeakClassifierError



%% Evaluate your strong classifier here
%  You can evaluate on the training data if you want, but you CANNOT use
%  this as a performance metric since it is biased. You MUST use the test
%  data to truly evaluate the strong classifier.



%% Plot the error of the strong classifier as a function of the number of weak classifiers.
%  Note: you can find this error without re-training with a different
%  number of weak classifiers.



%% Plot some of the misclassified faces and non-faces from the test set
%  Use the subplot command to make nice figures with multiple images.



%% Plot your choosen Haar-features
%  Use the subplot command to make nice figures with multiple images.
